# GitHub Search

## Description üìë

This is a small project aimed at mastering certain technologies and working with them in a unified
stack. The project consists of two pages, with the home page featuring a search function through the
GitHub API to search for users by their names. Upon selecting a user from the search results, a list
of the user's repositories is displayed. Each repository is shown as a card with some information
about it, and clicking on the card opens a new tab leading to that repository on GitHub.
Additionally, each card has a button to add the repository to favorites or remove it if it has
already been added to favorites before.

On the favorites page, the user can see all the repositories they have saved or see a message if no
repositories have been saved yet. On this page, the user can also click on a card to navigate to the
repository page or remove it from favorites.

Both pages also include a scroll-to-top button to enhance the user experience.

This project demonstrates the integration of different technologies and APIs, showcasing the ability
to interact with the GitHub platform and provide users with a convenient interface to search and
manage repositories. The implementation of the scroll-to-top button adds a thoughtful touch,
allowing users to easily navigate and improve their overall experience on the website.

## Installation ‚ö°Ô∏è

To launch a project on GitHub, you first need to clone the project to your local machine. For
instance, you can clone the project by running the command git clone
`https://github.com/vadymfrlv/rctstw-first.git` in your terminal.

After the project has been cloned, you need to navigate to the project directory and install any
dependencies that the project requires. You can do this by running the command `npm install` in your
terminal.

With these steps, you will have the project set up and running locally, allowing you to explore and
work with the technologies used in the project, such as Vite, React, and TypeScript. Once all
dependencies have been installed, you can start the development server by running the command <br>
`npm run dev`. This will launch the project in your default browser and any changes you make to the
code will automatically update in the browser.
